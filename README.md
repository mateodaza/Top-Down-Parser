# Top-Down-Parser
Given a context-free grammar on a txt file, the app will remove left recursion and apply left factoring if needed. 
Then based on FIRST and FOLLOW sets, it will generate a parse table which can be tested with some words examples. 
You can test it with the exemple.txt file that's in the folder.

This was a Compilers class project and the UI is on Spanish. I hope its useful somehow!
